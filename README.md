Abstract
The thesis focuses on the Menzerath-Altmann law, a well-known quantitative linguistic law, and tests it on Chinese language material. The law predicts that lengths of two language units of different hierarchical levels – a hierarchical higher construct and a hierarchical lower constituent – are negatively correlated. Over the last four decades, the law has been corroborated when applied to various languages, language units and materials. However, particular units are drawing more attention than others, and only one pair of the construct and its constituent is usually tested even though a unit can occupy different hierarchical positions. Moreover, it is generally presumed that the negative correlation between unit lengths appears when immediate hierarchical neighbours are analysed, but the unit neighbourhood is not always apparent. When shifting focus toward Chinese, on the one hand, two studies have already applied the law to a hierarchy of language units (Chen and Liu, 2019, 2022). On the other hand, both preferred the clause and the word as immediate hierarchical neighbours and left the phrase level out of the analysis. In addition, the studies yielded that the law does not come into force when applied to the word being the construct and the Chinese character being its constituent.
In reaction to this state, the thesis applies the Menzerath-Altmann law throughout a hierarchy of language units, i.e. sentence, clause, phrase, word, character/syllable, component/sound and stroke. Firstly, it analyses how non-peripheral units behave when they switch their hierarchical position from the constituent to the construct. Secondly, various unit combinations, including the phrase in its different positions, are tested to shed light on the unit neighbourhood in Chinese. Finally, the thesis examines what factors (e.g. frequency) prevent the law from coming into play when the word becomes involved. 
Based on the achieved results, several conclusions can be drawn. The law is capable of coming into force when the sentence, phrase, word and character are constructs. Only the clause yields the opposite results. Regarding the unit neighbourhood, the clause and the word do not appear to be immediate hierarchical neighbours, as well as the sentence and the phrase. Moreover, it can be preliminarily concluded that the phrase is a legitimate unit in the unit hierarchy in Chinese and that the law comes into force even if the word length measured in Chinese characters becomes not only the constituent but also the construct. The analyses also reveal that several crucial factors disable or enable the law to manifest itself. Firstly, in the case of the phrase and the word, the law manifests itself only if types, not tokens, are tested, i.e. unit frequency is not considered. Secondly, the phrase analysis shows that the law is sensitive to the sample homogeneity – the law comes into force only when applied to phrase types consisting solely of Chinese characters. Finally, the law manifests itself depending on an approach to the word segmentation (tokenisation) of language material. To sum it up, Menzerath-Altmann is, first and foremost, about considering competitive and cooperative factors which can influence the results and cast light on the behaviour of language units and the law itself.
